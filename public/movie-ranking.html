<h3>Furiosa</h3>
<p>George Miller’s long-awaited prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road delivers a raw and sprawling 
narrative about the titular character's origins. Featuring standout performances by Anya 
Taylor-Joy as Furiosa and Chris Hemsworth as the unsettling villain Dementus, the movie 
explores chaotic chapters of survival in the Wasteland. With intense sequences like War Rig 
raids and clashes with the Bullet Farm, Miller offers stunning visuals and a unique energy that 
complements its predecessor. While it doesn't surpass Fury Road, it stands as a worthy 
addition to the Mad Max saga, showcasing Miller’s masterful touch in action filmmaking​</p>
